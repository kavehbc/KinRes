# KinRes (Kinect Respiratory Monitoring)
This is a windows-based software to record human respiratory signal by using the Microsoft Kinect Xbox One (v2) sensor.

# Note
This online version runs with SMA filter and manual chest ROI detection. The Kalman filter is not included in this version on GitHub yet.
